> It is done as a part of course project M1 master course Scene Segmentation and Interpretation.
> And, It is implemented on Google Colaboratory in Tensorflows-Keras.


The implementation is based on [1] & [2].


Here, [COVID-19-CT-Seg_20cases](https://zenodo.org/record/3757476#.Xpz8OcgzZPY) are used for training and testing.
